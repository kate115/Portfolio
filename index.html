            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Melody Wang. This is my portfolio website, and I am proud to show you all about me in here. I have only a few
                hobbies, but I am very good in each and every one of them. My hobbies are writing, drawing, newspaper reading, reading
                reading in general, HTML, and a little bit of css. I will be covering my accomplishments in each hobby, other ones, and
                at the end, I will write them all down.
            </p>

                <h3>Writing</h3>
                <p>
                    For writing, I have some things to share with you. I use <a href="wattpad.com">Wattpad</a> to write novels and books I
                    don't want to really publish to the world yet. A short intro to Wattpad is that some users use it to write novels
                    they could share only with Wattpad users. It's like a private book maker to only a few people!
                    <br>
                    My Published Wattpad creations are:
                </p>
