            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Melody Wang. This is my portfolio website, and I am proud to show you all about me in here. I have only a few
                hobbies, but I am very good in each and every one of them. My hobbies are writing, drawing, newspaper reading, reading
                reading in general, HTML, and a little bit of css. I will be covering my accomplishments in each hobby, other ones, and
                at the end, I will write them all down.
            </p>

                <h3>Writing</h3>
                <p>
                    For writing, I have some things to share with you. I use Wattpad to write novels and books I
                    don't want to really publish to the world yet. A short intro to Wattpad is that some users use it to write novels
                    they could share only with Wattpad users. It's like a private book maker to only a few people!
                    <br>
                    My Published Wattpad creations are:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Most parts of Slug and Leaf</li>
                    <li>The Big (It's not so big) book of Dibs!</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    And the stuff I'm working on or have an idea for is here:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Galaxy From Beyond</li>
                    <li>Diary of a Cutie Girl</li>
                    <li>The End Part of Slug and Leaf</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                   I like newspapers too. I don't read them, though. But using my writing skill, I wrote one for my Elementary School,
                   Audubon. It's monthly, and I'm working on the 4th issue for next year. I like working on my writing, it's my best
                   hobby!
                </p>

                <h4>Comedy Stories</h4>
                <p>
                    I create funny comedy stories because when I was shy, I was in mmy writing camp. Then, when we had a story problem
                    wheel, and I got the option,"Too many flies," I tried to be brave and wrote what I could call "funny," and used
                    my courage to ask my teacher to read my story. To my surprise, everybody laughed. That is how I started my comedy
                    story career.
                </p>
                <h5>The Fly Family</h5>
                <p>
                    The fly family has many flies. Flora Fly, Floral Fly, Fiona Fly, Fenzie Fly, Forky Fly, Feshie Fly, Flesha Fly,
                    and Farzy Fly. The family wanted to meet the new family that moved to the Tree Neighborhood. They were the Buz's.
                    They were Bark Buz, Bluey Buz, Belissa Buz, and Borena Buz.
