                Hi, I'm Melody Wang. This is my portfolio website, and I am proud to show you all about me in here. I have only a few
                hobbies, but I am very good in each and every one of them. My hobbies are writing, drawing, newspaper reading, reading
                reading in general, HTML, and a little bit of css. I will be covering my accomplishments in each hobby, other ones, and
                at the end, I will write them all down.
            </p>
            <p>
                For writing, I have some things to share with you. I use <a href="wattpad.com">Wattpad</a>
